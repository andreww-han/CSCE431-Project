# CSCE431-Project
Group project for the Feminism4Aggies club
This project is designed to solve the following issues for the Feminism4Aggies club:
1. Tracking Membership points which can be earned through attending meetings or participating through events
2. Be able to show members announcements on the website
3. allow members to make posts and like other posts
4. show very general information about the club
  a. Since this is an internal tool and will be mainly static after development we do not want to
     include very topical/time oriented information on the website

For this project we used the following tools:
1. Ruby on Rails
2. Google Oauth for authentication
3. CSS and HTML for the frontend (we did not use a frontend framework such as React or Angular)
4. Docker for environment virtualization
5. Jira for Project Management
6. Github for version Control
7. MS Teams as primary communication channel

Challenges:
1. One of the main challenges we faced were with data design and being naive in ruby on rails
2. Google Oauth issues

Credits:
We would like to thank Professor Pauline Wade, Diego Martinez
